  abstract	= { We present an approach to prove safety (collision
		  freedom) of multi-lane motorway trac with lane-change
		  manoeuvres. This is ultimately a hybrid veri cation problem
		  due to the continuous dynamics of the cars. We abstract
		  from the dynamics by introducing a new spatial interval
		  logic based on the view of each car. To guarantee safety,
		  we present two variants of a lane-change controller, one
		  with perfect knowledge of the safety envelopes of
		  neighbouring cars and one which takes only the size of the
		  neighbouring cars into account. Based on these controllers
		  we provide a local safety proof for unboundedly many cars
		  by showing that at any moment the reserved space of each
		  car is disjoint from the reserved space of any other car.
